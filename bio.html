            <p> Alexander Koudijs is currently a Sophomore at Tufts University School of Engineering. He is pursuing a major in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Since his first AP computer programming class as a Sophomore at The Hotchkiss School, a New England Preparatory School located in Lakeville, Connecticut, Alexander has immersed himself into the world of computer engineering. The following summer, as a Junior, Alexander attended a summer program at Columbia University, where he learned the fundamentals of Engineering Design. Finally, during his Senior year at The Hotchkiss School, Alexander pursued an independent research project, where he built an autonomous drone, controllable through a computer interface. This fervor persisted even after his arrival in Medford, MA in the fall of 2013; during the summer of his Freshman year at Tufts, Alexander assisted one of his professors on a developing project, BlockyTalky, whose aim is to fashion a device through which younger generations may learn Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC).
